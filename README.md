# Android bootstrap app

This is a starter project, meant for bootstrapping web connected, HTTP communicating Android apps. This was built to support the presentation found in the Presentation folder. 


## Setup and libraries

* MVP setup
* Dependency injection using Dagger 2
* RxJava and RxAndroid
* Databinding
* Retrofit and OkHttp web stack
* Retrolambda 

## TODO

This project is still a WIP, a few of the missing features are the following:

* Simplified rotation/onconfigurationchange setup
* Cached data examples, memory and disk
* Espresso test example
* Unit test example

This list will most likely increase as work progresses and needs show themselves.
